# The Trainer

A living training ground for FourTwenty. Each **scroll** is a focused learning arc with:
- **Orbit** (where this belongs in the constellation)
- **Glyph** (emoji)
- **Ritual** (cadence & streak)
- **Quests** (bite‑size tasks)
- **Artifacts** (what you produce)
- **XP** (light gamification)

### How it works
1. Edit `/data/scrolls.yml` to add/modify scrolls.
2. Push to GitHub; **GitHub Pages** serves `index.html`.
3. The page reads your YAML and renders interactive cards.
4. Progress is stored in `localStorage` (your machine only).
5. Optional: GA4/GTM events fire on interactions.

### Constellation links
- ← Back to **Sandbox** (hub)
- → **The Launch**, **The Archive**, **The Signal**, **The Grower**, ...

## Rituals & Rules of Play
- **Daily Pulse** (10–30 min): move at least one quest forward.
- **WIP Limit = 3** active scrolls.
- **Weekly Retro**: log what shipped; queue next quests.
- **Boss Fight**: mock interview or live demo at end of a scroll.
